# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - debabelizer

**This package is deprecated and no longer maintained.**

## Important Notice

The `debabelizer` PyPI package has been deprecated. This was an experimental attempt to create high-performance Python bindings for a Rust implementation of the Debabelizer voice processing library.

### Status

- **Rust Implementation**: Works in isolation but has integration issues
- **Python Implementation**: Functional but not production-ready due to performance constraints
- **PyO3 Bindings**: Compile successfully but fail in real-world scenarios

### Known Issues

1. **Integration Problems**: Components work individually but fail when integrated
2. **Performance Gap**: Python version too slow (125s vs 17s for Rust)
3. **Reliability**: Neither implementation meets production reliability standards

### Recommendation

This project remains experimental. Users seeking production-ready voice processing solutions should consider established alternatives.

### Technical Details

The project attempted to solve Python's performance limitations by creating Rust bindings, achieving:
- 7.5x faster processing (17s vs 125s)
- 3.2x lower memory usage (10MB vs 33MB)
- 2.1x lower CPU usage (12% vs 25%)

However, these gains could not be reliably delivered due to PyO3 integration complexities.
