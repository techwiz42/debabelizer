## Advanced Usage

### Provider Configuration

Each example automatically detects configured providers. You can check which providers are available:

```python
from debabelizer import DebabelizerConfig

config = DebabelizerConfig()
providers = config.get_configured_providers()

print("STT Providers:", providers["stt"])
print("TTS Providers:", providers["tts"])
```

### Custom Configuration

You can customize provider settings:

```python
from debabelizer import VoiceProcessor, DebabelizerConfig

# Custom config
config = DebabelizerConfig({
    "soniox": {
        "model": "stt-rt-preview",
        "enable_profanity_filter": True,
    },
    "elevenlabs": {
        "model": "eleven_turbo_v2_5",
        "optimize_streaming_latency": 1,
    }
})

processor = VoiceProcessor(
    stt_provider="soniox",
    tts_provider="elevenlabs", 
    config=config,
    optimize_for="quality"  # or "latency", "cost"
)
```

### Error Handling

All examples include comprehensive error handling:

```python
try:
    result = await processor.transcribe_file("audio.wav")
    print(f"Transcription: {result.text}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Transcription failed: {e}")
```

## Audio Format Support

Debabelizer supports various audio formats:

- **Input**: WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG, M4A, AAC, WebM
- **Streaming**: PCM, mulaw (telephony)
- **Output**: WAV, MP3, mulaw (provider-dependent)

## Performance Tips

1. **Optimize for Use Case**:
   - `optimize_for="latency"` for real-time applications
   - `optimize_for="quality"` for high-quality results
   - `optimize_for="cost"` for cost-effective processing

2. **Provider Selection**:
   - **Soniox**: Best for accuracy and language detection
   - **Deepgram**: Fast and reliable, good for streaming
   - **ElevenLabs**: Highest quality TTS voices
   - **OpenAI**: Good general-purpose option

3. **Audio Quality**:
   - Use 16kHz sample rate for best results
   - Ensure good microphone quality for streaming
   - Use appropriate formats for your use case

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Provider not configured"**:
   - Check that API keys are set as environment variables
   - Verify the API key is valid and has sufficient credits

2. **"FFmpeg not available"**:
   - Install FFmpeg: `apt install ffmpeg` (Linux) or `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS)
   - Required for audio format conversion

3. **Streaming issues**:
   - Check microphone permissions
   - Ensure audio input device is working
   - Verify network connectivity for streaming APIs

4. **Audio quality issues**:
   - Use appropriate sample rates (8kHz for telephony, 16kHz+ for quality)
   - Check for background noise
   - Ensure proper audio levels

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Integration Examples

These examples demonstrate integration patterns for:

- **Web Applications**: Real-time voice features
